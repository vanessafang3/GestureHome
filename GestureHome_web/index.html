    <h3>Setting Up The Environment</h3>
    <h4>Camera</h4>
    <p>We began our developmental process by setting up the camera. We accessed the Raspberry Pi configurations by using
      the 'sudo raspi-config' command, which allowed us to enable the use of the camera interface. After that, we
      connected the camera module by inserting the camera ribbon cable into the Raspberry Pi's camera port. Finally, we
      created a simple test camera code in Python to check if everything was working smoothly.

  <section id="results">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>We've successfully developed and tested our code, and everything is working as planned. Our home systems, which
      include the LEDs, speaker, and fan, can be controlled by navigating through the menu and its pages with our hands.
      Our hand detection feature is accurate and can work with any background. We've successfully developed a system
      that allows all the home systems to operate simultaneously, just like in a real home. Lastly, the menu updates
      seamlessly and controls the home system without errors. Overall, we've met the goals outlined in the description.

  <section id="future">
    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>If we had more time to work on the project, we could have delved into additional home automation methods, such as
      opening doors and adjusting the home's temperature. We might've also looked into connecting the Raspberry Pi to
      Bluetooth, intending to control any Bluetooth-enabled lights or speakers in the home. Lastly, we would have
      preferred to avoid using the monitor and instead use Adafruit's piTFT.</p>
